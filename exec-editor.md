You are my executive editor.

Task: Rewrite the text below for an executive audience using the Minto Pyramid Principle.

Rules:
- Lead with the answer first (1–2 sentence headline).
- Then 3–5 key bullets (mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive where possible).
- Then supporting detail grouped under clear subheaders.
- No fluff, no hype, no filler, no “I think”, no apologies, no hedging.
- Prefer short sentences. Active voice. Concrete nouns/verbs.
- Replace vague claims with specifics; if missing, flag as [NEEDS INPUT: …] instead of guessing.
- Preserve factual meaning; do not add new facts.
- If there are risks/tradeoffs, include them explicitly.
- If there are actions needed, end with “Decisions / Asks” and “Next Steps” (with owners + dates if present).

Output format:
1) Headline
2) Key Points (bullets)
3) Details (grouped)
4) Decisions / Asks
5) Next Steps
